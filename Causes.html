The causes of World War II have been given considerable attention by historians. The immediate precipitating<br>
event was the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany on September 1, 1939, and the subsequent declarations of war<br>
on Germany made by Britain and France, but many other prior events have been suggested as ultimate causes. <br>
Primary themes in historical analysis of the war's origins include the political takeover of Germany in 1933<br>
by Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party; Japanese militarism against China, which led to the Japanese invasion of <br>
Manchuria and the Second Sino-Japanese War; Italian aggression against Ethiopia, which led to the Second Italo<br>
-Ethiopian War, the consent of Western countries to Germany's actions on the annexation of Austria and the <br>
partition of Czechoslovakia and Germany's initial success in negotiating the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact with <br>
the Soviet Union to divide the territorial control of Eastern Europe between them.During the interwar period,<br>
deep anger arose in the Weimar Republic on the conditions of the 1919 Treaty of Versailles, which punished <br>
Germany for its role in World War I with heavy financial reparations and severe limitations on its military<br>
that were intended to prevent it from becoming a military power again. The demilitarisation of the Rhineland,<br>
the prohibition of German unification with Austria, the loss of its overseas colonies and of some 12% of its <br>
pre-war land area and population provoked strong currents of revanchism in German politics.During the worldwide<br>
economic crisis of the Great Depression in the 1930s, many people lost faith in liberal democracy and countries <br>
across the world turned to authoritarian regimes.[1] In Germany, resentment over the terms of the Treaty of <br>
Versailles was intensified by the instability of the German political system, as many on both the Right and the<br>
Left rejected the Weimar Republic liberalism. The most extreme political aspirant to emerge from that situation <br>
was Adolf Hitler, the leader of the Nazi Party. The Nazis took totalitarian power in Germany from 1933 and <br>
demanded the undoing of the Versailles provisions. Their ambitious and aggressive domestic and foreign policies<br> 
reflected their ideologies of Antisemitism, unification of all Germans, the acquisition of "living space" <br>
(Lebensraum) for agrarian settlers, the elimination of Bolshevism and the hegemony of an "Aryan"/"Nordic" master<br> 
race over "subhumans" (Untermenschen) such as Jews and Slavs. Other factors leading to the war included the <br>
aggression by Fascist Italy against Ethiopia and by Imperial Japan against China.At first, the aggressive moves <br>
met with only feeble and ineffectual policies of appeasement from the other major world powers. The League of<br>
Nations proved helpless, especially regarding China andEthiopia. A decisive proximate event was the 1938 Munich <br>
Conference, which formally approved Germany's annexation of the Sudetenland from Czechoslovakia. Hitler promised<br>
it was his last territorial claim, nevertheless in early 1939, he became even more aggressive, and European<br>
governments finally realised that appeasement would not guarantee peace but by then it was too late.Britain and<br> 
France rejected diplomatic efforts to form a military alliance with the Soviet Union, and Hitler instead offered<br>
Stalin a better deal in the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939. An alliance formed by Germany, Italy, and <br>
Japan led to the establishment of the Axis powers.</p>
