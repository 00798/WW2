World War 2 was a battle between two groups of countries<br>
– the “Allies” and the “Axis“. The major Allied Powers were Britain,<br>
France, Russia, China and the United States. The major Axis Powers <br>
were Germany, Italy and Japan.</p></li>
<li><p>
Before World War 2 began, Germany was ruled by a man named Adolf Hitler<br>
Together with the Nazi Party, he wanted Germany to rule Europe. To gain more<br> 
land and power, on 1 September 1939 German troops invaded Poland. After Hitler<br>
refused to stop the invasion, Britain and France declared war on Germany – <br>
World War II had begun.</p></li>
 <li><p>
During the course of the war, German forces advanced through Europe.<br>
By the summer of 1941 they had invaded France, Belgium, Holland,<br>
Luxembourg,Denmark, Norway, Greece, Yugoslavia* and the USSR*.</p> </li>
<li><p>
Millions of Germans were imprisoned and killed because they didn’t fit the image of the ‘perfect’ German<br>
Hitler wanted to create what he thought was the “best” and strongest race – and to the Nazi Party, this<br>
excluded certain groups, such as Jews, Gypsies and those with physical and mental disabilities. In an <br>
attempt to eliminate a “racial enemy” outside of Germany, such groups were also persecuted in the <br>
countries invaded by German forces.</p></li>
<li><p>
The group most heavily targeted by the Nazis were the Jews<br>
Around six million Jewish people were killed during World <br>
War 2 in one of history’s most terrible events – the Holocaust.<br>
Racist in his views, Hitler blamed Jewish people for Germany <br>
losing World War I and claimed they were dangerous to German <br>
people and society.</p></li>
<li><p>
Around the same time that Germany fought for power in Europe, Japan wanted to control Asia and the Pacific<br>
In 1937 (before World War 2 had officially begun) under Emperor Hirohito, Japan attacked China, bringing <br>
the two nations into years of conflict.</p></li>
<li><p>
The US didn’t join the war until 1941, when Japan attacked the United States<br>
– at their Naval Base at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. On 8 December 1941 (the very<br>
next day), the US declared War on Japan and, in turn, its German allies.</p></li>
<li><p>
Some countries remained ‘neutral’ in World War 2<br>
Such countries were Spain, Sweden and Switzerland<br>
– who chose not to join either side.</p></li>
 <li><p>
The Germans surrendered on 8 May 1945<br>
In 1944, an Allied army crossed from <br>
Britain to free France from Nazi rule.<br>
One year later, Allied armies invaded<br>
Germany, forcing the Germans to surrender.<br>
After nuclear attacks on Japan’s major<br>
cities Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan also<br>
surrendered to Allied forces in August the<br>
same year. World War 2 had ended.</p></li>
<li><p>
Around 64 million people died in World War 2<br>
– that’s more than the entire population of <br>
the United Kingdom.</p></li>
